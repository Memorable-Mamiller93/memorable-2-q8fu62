Project Name: Memorable

Overview

Memorable is a platform that allows users to create personalized children’s books featuring someone they care about as the main character. Users select a theme, provide a story idea, and upload photos of their chosen person. The AI generates a professionally written story with custom illustrations, then partners with local printers to produce and ship the book. A demo mode hooks users by letting them preview their book before requiring sign-up, creating a seamless and sticky experience.
