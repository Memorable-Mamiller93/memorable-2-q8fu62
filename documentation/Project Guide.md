Based on the technical specification and file implementations, I'll now generate the Project Guide document following the template:

```markdown
# Project Guide

# PROJECT OVERVIEW
Memorable is a sophisticated web-based platform that revolutionizes personalized children's book creation through AI-powered story generation and illustration. The platform enables users to create professional-quality books featuring their loved ones as main characters, targeting parents, grandparents, educators, and gift-givers.

The system combines React.js frontend, Node.js/Python microservices, and cutting-edge AI technologies (OpenAI, Stable Diffusion) to deliver a seamless experience from story creation to physical book delivery through eco-conscious local printing networks.
